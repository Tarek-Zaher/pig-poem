Innocent fish swimming through your water
Breathing, miraculously, with gills.
Please know, the fisherman treats his daughter
With caring consideration for her pain.
He just knows what he learned from his father:
That suffering never reaches your brain.

If someone ran a hook through the cheek of his angel
He would probably weep and cry.

I'm sorry, but from now on on me you can rely
